# Surfs Up

# Overview of the analysis:
W. Avy liked our first analysis so much that he had asked us for more information as to whether the ice cream shop could be profitable year-round, specifically on the months of June and December.

# Results:
After our research, we were able to determine the following:
* June’s average temperature is 74.94 compared to December’s 71.04. This makes June 3.9 degrees higher than December.
* June also had the highest temperature recorded. However, June’s highest was slightly higher than December’s with a difference only of 2 degrees.
* The most dramatic difference in weather is for sure the difference in lowest temperatures. June recorded a 64 degree whereas December recorded a low of 56 degrees. Making December the coldest month of the year.

# Summary:
After our review, we also determine that we needed to add rain levels to our analysis, since Hawaii is a state where it could rain at any moment and rain could be a deterrent for surfers and customers alike from visiting our ice cream shop.
Please see below images for more details.
